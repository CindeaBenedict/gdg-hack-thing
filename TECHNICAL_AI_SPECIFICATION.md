## Core AI Architecture

### 1. Multi-Layer Document Processing Pipeline

#### Layer 1: Document Ingestion & Text Extraction
- **Multi-format Support**: DOCX, PDF, XLSX, JSON, PPTX
- **Language Detection**: Automatic detection of document languages using `franc-min` library
- **Single-file Multilingual**: Can process documents containing multiple languages by automatically splitting content by detected language
- **Structured Extraction**: Preserves document structure (tables, headers, paragraphs) for context-aware analysis

#### Layer 2: Semantic Segmentation
- **Intelligent Chunking**: Documents are segmented into logical units (sentences, paragraphs, clauses)
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains document structure and relationships between segments
- **Language-specific Processing**: Adapts segmentation rules based on detected language patterns

#### Layer 3: Cross-Document Alignment
- **Greedy Alignment Algorithm**: Matches corresponding segments across documents using lexical similarity
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Handles variations in wording, formatting, and structure
- **Multi-document Support**: Can compare 2+ documents simultaneously

### 2. AI-Powered Consistency Verification

#### IBM watsonx.ai Integration
- **Model**: IBM Granite 3.2 8B Instruct (configurable)
- **API Endpoint**: IBM Cloud Machine Learning (us-south region)
- **Authentication**: IAM token-based authentication with API key management

#### Prompt Engineering for Legal Documents
```
System Role: AI consistency auditor specializing in multilingual legal document verification
Task: Compare document segments for factual consistency across languages
Focus Areas: Numbers, dates, monetary amounts, legal entities, contractual terms
Output Format: Structured JSON with confidence scores and detailed explanations
```

#### Verification Process
1. **Semantic Analysis**: Each document pair is analyzed for semantic equivalence
2. **Factual Validation**: Specific attention to numerical data, dates, and monetary values
3. **Confidence Scoring**: AI provides confidence levels (0.0-1.0) for each comparison
4. **Issue Classification**: Categorizes discrepancies by type (number, date, monetary, entity)

### 3. Hybrid Verification Architecture

#### Rule-Based Validation
- **Deterministic Checks**: Hard-coded rules for obvious discrepancies
- **Pattern Matching**: Regex-based detection of common inconsistency patterns
- **Threshold-based Filtering**: Configurable similarity thresholds for different content types

#### LLM Semantic Validation
- **Context Understanding**: AI comprehends meaning beyond literal text matching
- **Cultural/Linguistic Nuances**: Handles language-specific expressions and legal terminology
- **Reasoning Capabilities**: Can identify logical inconsistencies and contradictions

#### Consensus Engine
- **Weighted Scoring**: Combines rule-based and AI confidence scores
- **Risk Assessment**: Assigns risk levels (OK/REVIEW/MISMATCH) based on combined analysis
- **False Positive Reduction**: AI reasoning helps reduce false alarms from rule-based systems
